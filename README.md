The following is an exploratory project using Tableau to make data visualizations of my job search in 2024. 

As a Tableau newbie, the visualizations are quite basic... 

However, they depict my journey so far, showcasing analyses such as:
- number of applications submitted by month
- recruitment systems used by various companies
- rejection rates per recruitment systems

The visualizations will hopefully demonstrate which kinds of recruitment systems send rejections (or any updates at all)  vs. those that tend to ghost their applicants. 

In tHiS eCoNOmY, the job market is quite terrible for the job seekers. While I am using this as a project to improve upon my Tableau skills, I have some semblence of hope that a recruiter will take a look at this and take a chance on me.
